# React-Social-Media-App
## The React Social Media Dashboard is a modular web application built using Reactâ€™s useState Hook, props, and a component-based structure. It features four main sections: a Topbar with a real-time search bar to filter posts by username or caption, a Leftbar containing static navigation options (like Feed, Chats, Groups) with a toggleable friend list, a Feed Section displaying dynamic posts through reusable components, and a Rightbar showing birthday notifications and a list of online friends. The project emphasizes clean UI, real-time interactivity, and reusable, scalable components for a smooth and engaging user experience.
